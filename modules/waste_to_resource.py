    Dummy function to classify waste based on the average brightness of the image.
    
    This demonstration function converts the image to grayscale and computes
    its average pixel value:
      - If the average brightness is low (< 100), it classifies the waste as "organic".
      - If the average brightness is moderate (between 100 and 150), it classifies as "metal".
      - Otherwise, it classifies as "plastic".
    
    In production, you would replace this logic with a deep learning model (for example,
    a fine-tuned convolutional neural network) that accurately identifies waste types.
